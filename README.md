# CrytpoCoinCount

This project is a react app that provides the user with an up-to-date look at various forms of cryptocurrencies.

## How Does it Work
Currently, only these six coins are being provided: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, Monero, and Ripple(XRP). Each coin has a page providing the user with currency conversions to Dollars (USD) and Bitcoin (with the exception being the actual Bitcoin page). For each conversion, there is a price change and percentage change with both tallying data over the previous 24 hours. The last item on each page is a description of the coin itself courtesy of Investopedia.
